# README Generator challenge

## Description

My motivation for this project was to make a README.md generator. This consists of using inquirer to collect user data to write into a README.md. I generated the README in a separate 'generateMarkdown' js file as it had functions involving getting the license links and badges. Then the generateMarkdownFn was exported to the index.js file to use fs to write a new .md file with the users project name as the title. I accomplished this with my skills in js and my knew knowledge of inquirer and fs. 

## Installation

You will need to use node.js. Once installed type 'npm init' and 'npm i inquirer@8.2.4' into the integrated termail of the 'Develop' folder to install the content needed for this program.

## Usage

To use this program in the same integrated terminal as used before type 'node index.js' to run the program.
